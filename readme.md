###What it does:

-   Automatic Time Tracking: It automatically tracks the time you spend actively using your Chrome browser.

-   Project/Category Management: You can assign your active Browse time to different "projects" or "categories" (like "Work," "Study," "Personal," or any custom name you create).

-   Idle Time Detection & Categorization:

    -   It detects when you've been inactive (idle) for a set period (e.g., 60 seconds).

    -   When you become active again after an idle period, it pops up a window. This prompt asks you what you were doing during your idle time, allowing you to either:

    -   Categorize that idle time to a specific project.

    -   Discard that idle time.

    -   It then asks you to set your new active project for ongoing tracking.

-   On-Demand Project Switching: From the extension's popup, you can manually change your current active project at any time, even if you haven't been idle. You can select an existing project or add a completely new one.

-   Time Summary: The extension's popup provides a quick summary of the total time you've spent on each project/category.

-   Data Persistence: All your tracked time and project names are saved locally in your browser, so your data remains even if you close Chrome or restart your computer.

-   Data Reset: There's an option to completely reset all your tracked data and project history.
